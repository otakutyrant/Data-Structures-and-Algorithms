len(stack) > 0 and stack.peek()

be careful for any number represented by str, and negative number especially

sometimes it is useful to add a char into a string to make the artifical cause of pop, like '1 + 3' + ' ' and '/home/'

sometimes it is useful to store some useful informations via forward iterations, and via backward iterations to find pattern. like 456: 132 pattern
